        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            A <strong>Cobb salad</strong> is an American dish that consists of <em>lettuce</em> topped with <em>bacon</em>, 
            <em>chicken, boiled eggs, tomatoes</em>, and other ingredients arranged in neat rows. 
            It is traditionally served as a main course. The origins of the classic salad is unclear, 
            but many believe it was created in the late 1930s at the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood.
